        "description": "Open Concept Lab is a limited liability corporation whose mission is to create a global, open-source, collaborative platform for creating and accessing standardized healthcare terminology. OCL is a recognized Digital Public Good that is used by Ministries of Health, NGOs, and other organizations, especially among low and middle income countries, to manage healthcare terminologies and to support health information exchange. OCL supports FHIR R4B. OCL is free to download and use, and also offers a hosted solution called OCL Online, that is preloaded with terminologies that are important to resource constrained environments, such as LOINC, SNOMED GPS, ICD-10, and the Columbia International eHealth Laboratory. OCL Online is used to manage metadata that is deployed in thousands of health care facilities throughout Africa, and is the software that powers national terminology service deployments in several countries including Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Brazil. OCL supports a global community of practice of terminologists, academics, engineers, and public health practitioners.",

This approach significantly improves the quality of mapping candidates, but it does not take previous mapping decisions into account to inform candidate generation. An \"AI Terminology Mapping Agent\" would transform this into a learning system, that makes mapping recommendations to users and that gets better over time. Terminologists are expensive and rare, especially in the resource-constrained settings where we are focused, so tools that reduce the level of effort required of a senior terminologist are critical. This AI agent would allow a users in a rural setting in a low-income country to benefit from the mapping decisions that other community have made.",
